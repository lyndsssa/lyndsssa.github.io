# Food You Love App

Link to my website:
https://lyndsssa.github.io/unit_one_project/

## Description of App
My App is called "Food You Love". It is geared towards users who are looking to find a recipe but not exactly sure what they want. Users can simply type in any keyword of the type of food cuisine they are interested in, hit the go button and the api will bring up all recipes related to the search. Users can then click on one of the list items that looks interesting and it will provide a photo with cooking instructions. If they do not want that one they can simply click the back button in browser or go to the dropdown menu and select from a few other cuisine options.

## Technologies Used
To do this I used HTML for the bones, CSS to style everything shown on page, Javascript, Jquery to manipulate the DOM. I also used ajax  to provide the user with data pulled from api.

My site is also a responsive design meaning you can see it on a computer, tablet, iphone and see the same thing without it looking squished, fits the size of the device using.

I added in a few hover's throughout the site. Mainly for easier user experience. I also added a tool tip over the GO button (aka submit). This just reminds the user to click GO in order to see the search results. I made it only appear when the user puts the cursor over the GO button. I made it transparent so it is not obnoxious.

I made the data list only appear when the user first searches, then the long list disappears when they click on the item link they want to view.

## Main approach
The first step to creating my app was to draw out my thoughts and ideas. Once I decided what I wanted to do I then researched API's I could potentially use. Once I got that approved it was time to start working. I began with making all the files needed for the project then put the main bones in html and css just to see what I could get on the site. From there I decided to write out everything I needed and wanted to do with the data from API. I then spent most of my time in the app.js file to connect the API and make AJAX calls. I figured out how to filter through the given data in order to create working functions. I also built/ created all of the detailed information on my site through Jquery. Everytime I would get something to work through my .js file I would go to css and style it so it looked somewhat appealing. I found this easier for me to see what was happening where and what I wanted it to do in that specific spot. I then went back and finished styling my site in CSS.

## Unsolved problems
If I had more time I would like to figure out how to make a go back button, or something so the user can just click it to go back to the list of items they searched for. Because right now once they click on the desired item the list disappears, info about that item appears.  They cannot go back unless they use the back button in the browser. I also do not know how to have my site "start fresh" so once the user clicks on the desired item they have the info pulled up then they want to search something else, when they do so the current item that was chosen stays on the page and the new option list appears above it. I would also try to make the background image clear or change it completely.
