My website is called "Food You Love". It is geared towards users who are looking to find a recipe but not sure exactly what they want. When you go to the main site you can type in any keyword of the type of food cuisine your interested in, hit the go button and the api will bring up all recipes related to the search. Users can then click on the one that looks interesting and it will show a photo with cooking instructions. If they do not want that one they can simply click the back button in browser or go to the dropdown menu and select from a few other cuisine options.

To do this I used HTML for the bones and main article on the site, CSS to style everything shown on page, javascript, jquery and ajax to create functions, loops, etc. that work with ajax to provide the user with data.

My site is also a responsive design meaning you can see it on a computer, tablet, iphone and see the same thing without it looking squished, fits the size of the device using.

I added in a few hover's throughout the site. Mainly for easier user experience. I also added a tool tip over the GO button (aka submit). This just reminds the user to click GO in order to see the search results. I made it only appear when the user puts the cursor over the GO button. I made it transparent so it is not obnoxious.

I made the data list only appear when the user first searches, then the long list disappears when they click on the item link they want to view.

If I had more time I would like to figure out how to make a go back button, or something so the user can just click it to go back to the list of items they searched for. Because right now once they click on the desired item the list disappears, info about that item appears.  They cannot go back unless they use the back button in the browser. I also do not know how to have my site "start fresh" so once the user clicks on the desired item they have the info pulled up then they want to search something else, when they do so the current item that was chosen stays on the page and the new option list appears above it. I would also try to make the background image clear or change it completely.
